# Awesome Interface

## About Awesome Interface
Awesome Interface is a series of tweaks to make the game work the way I want it to.  See the features below for more information.  Everything is optional.

## Features

### Bounty
A timer can be added to the bounty bar displays minutes remainng until your bounty expires.

### Buffs
A buff bar can be attached to the Framerate and Latency Meters.  This bar displays all current buffs.  Clicking on a buff will hide it.

### Chat
The chat window can be hidden when in combat.  This setting can also be disabled if you are in a group.

### Clock
A local clock can be added to the Framerate and LAtency Meter bar.

### Compass
The compass can be (and should be) hidden at all times.

### Durability
A box, colored to the quality of the gear item, is drawn around that item in the paper doll window when you open your character sheet.  The height of the box indicates the durability of the item.  The item's level is displayed at the top of the box.

### Navigation
An arrow can be displayed on your target reticle, indicating the direction to the next quest item.  A distance meter can be displayed below the target reticle to indicate how far away the target is. An Arrow with a circle indicates that you need to search an area.

### POIs
Points of Interest.  There are too many displayed on the world map.  Wayshrines can be set to only display capital cities.  Dungeons, and houses can be hidden on the world map, but still displayed on the zone map.

### Quests
I hate the quest markers in ESO, so I added some old school WoW icons.  Yellow for normal quests, green for zone stories, blue for dailies, grey for completed quests.  This works in the compass, minimap, the QuestMap addon, minimap addons, and the floating markers in the game world.

### Repair
Something every game needs and none have.  Auto-repair at any vendor capable of it.

### Reticle
This can add compass directions to your target reticle (N, S, SE, NW, etc)

### Target
This adds extended information about a player.  Gender, faction, CP, level, race, class, etc.  It can also color your target reticle.  Green/Yellow for NPCs, Red for attackable targets, Blue for players.

### XP
This can add a percentage label to your XP bar.  It can also display the XP bar in the game world.
